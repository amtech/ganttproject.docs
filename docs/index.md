Title: Getting Started

# Welcome to GanttProject Docs

## User Docs

These pages provide documentation for some of GanttProject's features. This is by no means
a comprehensive manual and is not planned to be. GanttProject application is simple and friendly
enough to be used without any manuals. However, there are some non-trivial points and rough corners
which are documented here.

You may also want to checkout [Frequently Asked Questions](http://ganttproject.blogspot.com/search/label/faq)
which are published on our blog pages.

## Developer Docs

Developer docs provide instructions on building GanttProject and contributing code.
